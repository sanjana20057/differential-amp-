Basic operations on differential amplifier.


What is a Differential Amplifier??

   a Differential Amplifier is a type of amplifier which amplifies the dfference between two input  voltages and eleminates any common voltages that lies between the inputs. It has two inputs and one common output.This is why the differential amplifier is also known as a difference amplifier â€“ the difference between the input voltages is amplified.

EXPERIMENT 3:

Design and analyse differential amplifier with specifications given as follows : Vdd= 2.2V, P<=2.2mW, Vocm= 1.25V, Vicm= 1.2V, Vp=0.4V. Perform: DC analysis, transient analysis,frequency response and extract the parameters. length=180nm

Id>= P/Vdd (because P<= 2.2mA)
   = 2.2mV/2.2V
   =1mA


>Id1=(Id/2)

   =(1mA/2)

   =0.5mA


>Id2=Id-Id1
   
   =1mA-0.5mA
   
   =0.5mA

>Rd=(Vdd-Vocm)/Id1
  
   =(2.2-1.25)V/0.5mA
  
   =1.9k ohm


>Rss=(Vp/Iss)
  
   =0.4V/1mA
 
   =0.4k ohm
   
   =400 ohm
